# Saucenao Image Urls Searcher

Uses a text file of image urls to find "sauce" for images. Outputs a file with links to the "sauce" as determined by saucenao.

## Setup

**You must create a file called `api_key` with only your saucenao api key.**

Python 3.6 only.

Run the script as such:
```bash
python3 search_sauce.py urls.txt source_links.md
```

**I did not write `saucenao.py`. I forgot where I got it from, though...**
